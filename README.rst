Installation
------------

On a Posix System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You really want to contribute, right?

::

    git clone https://github.com/hobson/pug.git

If your a user and not a developer, and have an up-to-date posix OS with
the postgres, xml2, and xlst development packages installed, then just
use ``pip``.

::

    pip install pug

Fedora
~~~~~~

If you're on Fedora >= 16 but haven't done a lot of python binding
development, then you'll need some libraries before pip will succeed.

::

    sudo yum install -y python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc-gfortran python-scikit-learn postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-libs postgresql-devel
    pip install pug

Bleeding Edge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even the releases are very unstable, but if you want to have the latest,
most broken code

::

    pip install git+git://github.com/hobsonlane/pug.git@master

Warning
~~~~~~~

This software is in alpha testing. Install at your own risk.

Development
-----------
